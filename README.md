<h3>Task 1: The class Movie is stated below. An instance of class Movierepresents a film. This class has the following three properties:</h3>
            <ul style="margin-top: 10px">
              <li>
                title, which is a String representing the title of the movie
              </li>
              <li>
                studio, which is a String representing the studio that made the
                movie
              </li>
              <li>
                rating, which is a String representing the rating of the movie
                (i.e. PG­13, R, etc)
              </li>
            </ul>
              <br />
             <ol>
                <li>
                  Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String
                  representing the title of the movie, a String representing the
                  studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments,
                  and sets the respective class properties to these values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The constructor for the class Movie will set the class
                  property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie
                  as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies
                  in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the
                  input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array
                  need not be full.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class
                  Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon
                  Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”
                </li>
              </ol>
            <h3>Task 2: Circle - Class: Convert the UML diagram to Typescript class. - use
            number for double</h3>
            <h3>Task 3: Write a “person” class to hold all the details</h3>
            <h3>Task 4: Write a class to calculate the Uber price.</h3>

<h4>Note: Created simple Ui and also used concepts like OOP, getter-setter, etc. And attached the UI and Console snapshot below</h4><br/>
